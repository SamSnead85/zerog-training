            "question": "When should you consider fine-tuning instead of RAG?",
            "options": [
                "When you need to add frequently changing knowledge",
                "When you need consistent style, format, or domain vocabulary",
                "When you have less than 10 examples",
                "When you need real-time data"
            ],
            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fine-tuning is best for baking in consistent style, format, or domain-specific language. RAG is better for updatable knowledge."

            "options": [
                "10-20 examples",

            ],
            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "For simple format adherence, 50-100 high-quality examples are typically sufficient. More complex behaviors need more data."

            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Fine-tuning bakes knowledge permanently into the model. For facts that change, RAG is better as it can be updated without retraining."

            ],
            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "The recommended distribution is 60% common scenarios, 20% edge cases, 10% error handling, and 10% boundary enforcement."

            ],
            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "Model distillation trains a smaller/cheaper model (like GPT-4o mini) to produce outputs matching a larger model (like GPT-4o), reducing costs while maintaining quality."

            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "Including examples of appropriate refusals teaches the model boundaries—what requests to decline and how to decline them gracefully."

            ],
            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "OpenAI fine-tuning uses JSONL format where each line is a complete JSON object representing one training example."

            "options": [
                "To reduce training costs only",
                "To encourage the model to memorize specific responses",
                "To prevent the model from overweighting similar examples",
                "To make validation easier"
            ],
            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "Near-duplicate examples waste training budget and can cause the model to overfit to specific phrasings rather than learning general patterns."

            ],
            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fine-tuning examples must end with an assistant message, as this is what the model is being trained to produce."

            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Quality beats quantity in fine-tuning. 100 excellent examples that demonstrate ideal behavior often outperform 1,000 mediocre ones."
