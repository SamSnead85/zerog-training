## The ZeroG Difference: Technology That Teaches

Most learning platforms are content delivery systems. They push slides, track clicks, and report completions. But completion doesn't equal competence. Pass rates don't equal performance.

**ZeroG is different by design.**

We've built a platform where every feature is grounded in learning science—cognitive load theory, spaced repetition, deliberate practice, and adult learning principles. The result is training that actually changes behavior and builds capability.
