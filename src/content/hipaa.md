# Advanced HIPAA Compliance Training
## Beyond Checkbox Compliance: Building a Culture of Patient Privacy

> **Role-Based Training That Prepares Your Organization for OCR Audits and Protects Patient Trust**

---

## The Stakes Have Never Been Higher

HIPAA violations don't just result in fines—they destroy patient trust, damage reputations, and can expose individuals to criminal liability. With the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) increasing enforcement actions and breach penalties reaching into the millions, organizations need training that goes far beyond annual awareness refreshers.

**ZeroG's Advanced HIPAA Compliance curriculum delivers the depth your organization needs.**

## Why Generic HIPAA Training Fails

| Traditional Approach | ZeroG Approach |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Same content for everyone | Role-specific curricula for clinical, admin, IT, and leadership |
| Focus on definitions | Focus on application and decision-making |
| Annual checkbox exercise | Continuous learning with quarterly updates |
| Theoretical scenarios | Real enforcement case studies with lessons learned |
| Pass/fail quiz | Performance-based assessment in realistic situations |

## Four Role-Based Learning Paths

HIPAA affects different roles in different ways. A nurse's daily decisions about PHI are fundamentally different from an IT administrator's security configurations or a privacy officer's audit preparations. We've designed four distinct learning paths to address these differences.

---

## Learning Path 1: HIPAA for Clinical Staff
### *Physicians, Nurses, Technicians, and Clinical Support*

**Duration:** 6 hours | **Modules:** 8 | **Level:** Role-Specific

Clinical staff interact with PHI constantly. This path focuses on the privacy decisions they face every day with patients, families, and colleagues.

### Modules

**Duration:** 45 min | **Rule Alignment:** Privacy Rule Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify what constitutes Protected Health Information (PHI) in clinical contexts

- Recognize how HITECH Act enhanced HIPAA requirements

**Core Topics:**
- The 18 HIPAA identifiers and PHI examples
- Covered entities: Health plans, clearinghouses, providers
- Business associates and the chain of responsibility
- HITECH Act: Breach notification, enforcement, EHR incentives

**Key Takeaways:**
- Nearly everything you document or discuss about a patient is PHI
- HIPAA applies to verbal, written, and electronic information
- Violations can result in personal liability—not just organizational fines

---

#### Module C1.2: The Privacy Rule in Clinical Practice
**Duration:** 60 min | **Rule Alignment:** 45 CFR §164.500-534

**Scenario Exercise:**
> *A patient is unconscious in the ED. Their adult child arrives and demands to see mom's medical records and speak to the doctor. A man claiming to be the patient's husband calls asking for information. How do you handle each situation?*

---
