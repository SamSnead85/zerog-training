## Leadership That Matters

Leadership development is one of the largest training investments organizations make—and one of the least effective. Studies show that only 10% of leadership training produces meaningful behavior change, and less than half of organizations believe their leadership development programs are excellent.

**ZeroG's Modern Leadership Development curriculum changes that equation.**

Built on validated competency models, grounded in learning science, and delivered through practice-intensive methods, our program develops leaders who actually lead differently—not just leaders who've completed a course.

## The ZeroG Leadership Competency Model

Our curriculum is built on a comprehensive, research-validated competency model that addresses the full spectrum of leadership requirements:

## Three Leadership Journeys

We recognize that leadership development needs vary by career stage. A new manager needs different skills than a seasoned VP. Our three learning paths address these different needs:

---

## Learning Path 1: Emerging Leaders
### *For New and Aspiring Managers*

**Duration:** 24 hours | **Modules:** 12 | **Level:** Foundational

The transition from individual contributor to manager is one of the most challenging in any career. This path equips new leaders with the fundamental skills to lead effectively from day one.

### Curriculum

#### Section 1: Leading Self (Foundation)

**Module E1.1: The Leadership Transition**
**Duration:** 90 min | **Competency:** Self-Awareness

**Learning Objectives:**
- Recognize the identity shift required when moving from IC to manager
- Identify personal leadership strengths and development areas
- Create a 90-day leadership development plan

**Core Topics:**

**The Identity Shift**
Moving into leadership requires a fundamental change in how you define success:

| As Individual Contributor | As Leader |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Success = My work quality | Success = Team's work quality |
| Impact = My output | Impact = Team's output |
| Skills = Technical expertise | Skills = People + Technical |
| Value = What I produce | Value = What I enable |

**Common New Manager Mistakes:**
1. Continuing to do IC work instead of delegating
2. Managing tasks rather than developing people
3. Avoiding difficult conversations
4. Taking credit for team wins (or blame for their losses incorrectly)
5. Being either too hands-on or too hands-off

**Self-Assessment:** Leadership Styles Inventory with debrief

---

**Module E1.2: Emotional Intelligence in Leadership**
**Duration:** 120 min | **Competency:** Emotional Intelligence

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply the five components of emotional intelligence in leadership contexts
- Regulate emotional responses in stressful leadership situations
- Read and respond to team members' emotional states effectively

**Core Topics:**

**The Five Components (Goleman Model):**

| Component | Definition | Leadership Application |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| **Self-Awareness** | Knowing your emotions, strengths, weaknesses | Understanding your leadership impact |
| **Self-Regulation** | Managing disruptive emotions and impulses | Staying composed under pressure |
| **Motivation** | Passion for work beyond money/status | Persisting through challenges |
| **Empathy** | Understanding others' emotional makeup | Reading team dynamics |
| **Social Skills** | Managing relationships and networks | Building influence and collaboration |

**Scenario Practice:**
> *Your top performer, Jordan, has been increasingly disengaged over the past month. They've been late to meetings, less vocal in discussions, and just submitted work with uncharacteristic errors. How do you approach this situation?*

**Lab: Emotional Response Analysis using real workplace scenarios**

---

**Module E1.3: Communication Mastery**
**Duration:** 120 min | **Competency:** Communication

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply active listening techniques to fully understand team members
- Deliver clear, actionable feedback using structured frameworks
- Adapt communication style to different audiences and situations

**Core Topics:**

**Active Listening:**
- HEAR model: Halt, Engage, Anticipate, Replay
- Listening barriers and how to overcome them
- Questions that deepen understanding vs. questions that close conversation

**Feedback Frameworks:**

**The SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact):**
```
"In yesterday's client meeting [SITUATION],
when you interrupted Sarah twice during her presentation [BEHAVIOR],
the client looked confused and Sarah lost her train of thought [IMPACT]."
```

**The COIN Model for Development Conversations:**
- **C**onnection: "I've noticed you've been working hard on..."
- **O**bservation: "I observed that..."
- **I**mpact: "The impact has been..."
- **N**ext Steps: "Let's discuss how we might..."

**AI Simulation: Practice feedback conversations with varying difficulty levels**

---

**Module E1.4: Delegation and Empowerment**
**Duration:** 90 min | **Competency:** Empowerment

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply the delegation spectrum to assign work appropriately
- Match delegation level to team member capability and task criticality
- Avoid common delegation pitfalls (over-delegation and under-delegation)

**Core Topics:**

**The Delegation Spectrum:**

| Level | You Do | Together You | They Do |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Decide and do | — | — |
| 2 | Decide and explain | — | They do |
| 3 | Gather input | Decide together | They do |
| 4 | Recommend | They decide | They do |
| 5 | — | — | They decide and do |

**When to Use Each Level:**
- Consider: Task complexity, consequence of failure, development opportunity, time available
- New team members: Start at 1-2, increase as competence grows
- Experienced team members: Aim for 4-5 to maximize autonomy

---

**Module E1.5: Building High-Performing Teams**
**Duration:** 120 min | **Competency:** Team Leadership

**Learning Objectives:**
- Diagnose team development stage using Tuckman's model
- Apply appropriate interventions for each development stage
- Create conditions for psychological safety

**Core Topics:**

**Tuckman's Team Development Model:**

| Stage | Characteristics | Leader's Role |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Forming** | Polite, uncertain, dependent on leader | Provide direction, clarity |
| **Storming** | Conflict emerges, jockeying for position | Facilitate, coach, don't avoid |
| **Norming** | Agreeing on standards, developing cohesion | Step back, support norms |
| **Performing** | High productivity, autonomous | Delegate, celebrate, challenge |

**Psychological Safety:**
Google's Project Aristotle found that psychological safety—the belief that you won't be punished for speaking up—was the #1 factor in team effectiveness.

**Building Safety:**
- Model fallibility: Admit your own mistakes
- Frame work as learning problems, not execution problems
- Invite input explicitly: "What am I missing?"
- Respond productively to bad news: Thank, don't blame
- Sanction clear violations: Safety doesn't mean no accountability

---

**Module E1.6: Performance Management**
**Duration:** 90 min | **Competency:** Performance Management

**Learning Objectives:**
- Set clear, measurable performance expectations
- Conduct effective performance conversations throughout the cycle
- Address performance problems early and constructively

- One-on-one meeting best practices
- Continuous feedback culture
- Addressing underperformance: Diagnosis and intervention
- Documentation and HR partnership

---

#### Section 2: Leading Others (Application)

**Module E1.7: Coaching for Development**
**Duration:** 90 min | **Competency:** Coaching

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply the GROW coaching model in development conversations
- Distinguish between coaching, mentoring, and directing
- Ask powerful questions that promote self-discovery

**Core Topics:**

**The GROW Model:**
```
G - Goal: What do you want to achieve?
R - Reality: Where are you now? What have you tried?
O - Options: What could you do? What else?
W - Will: What will you do? When? How committed are you?
```

**Powerful Questions:**
- Instead of: "Why don't you try X?" → Try: "What options do you see?"
- Instead of: "Have you considered Y?" → Try: "What haven't you considered yet?"
- Instead of: "I would do Z" → Try: "What would success look like?"

**AI Coaching Simulation: Practice the GROW model across multiple scenarios**

---

**Module E1.8: Difficult Conversations**
**Duration:** 120 min | **Competency:** Conflict Resolution

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply structured approaches to difficult conversations

**The Crucial Conversations Framework:**
1. **Start with Heart:** What do you really want for yourself, them, the relationship?
2. **Master Your Story:** Separate facts from interpretations
3. **STATE Your Path:** Share facts, Tell your story, Ask for their path, Talk tentatively, Encourage testing

**Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan):**

Three innate psychological needs that drive intrinsic motivation:

| Need | Definition | How Leaders Support It |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| **Autonomy** | Control over one's work | Provide choice, reduce micromanagement |
