# Module 5 Capstone Project: Custom Domain Model

> **Duration**: 8-10 hours | **Type**: Comprehensive Assessment
> **Submission**: Fine-Tuned Model + Documentation

---

## Project Overview

Fine-tune a model for a specific domain or task. Create the dataset, train, evaluate, and document the process.

---

## Requirements

### Part 1: Use Case Definition (1 hour)

- Define the specific task
- Justify why fine-tuning (not prompting/RAG)
- Document expected behavior changes

### Part 2: Dataset Creation (3 hours)

- 500+ training examples
- 50+ test examples (held out)
- Diversity across expected inputs
- Quality validation

### Part 3: Training (2 hours)

- Execute fine-tuning (OpenAI or open-source)
- Document hyperparameters chosen
- Track training metrics

### Part 4: Evaluation (2 hours)

- Compare to baseline model
- Task-specific metrics
- LLM-as-judge evaluation
- Error analysis

### Part 5: Documentation (2 hours)

- Full process documentation
- Results with statistical analysis
- Recommendations for production
