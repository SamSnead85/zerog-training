# Module 5: Fine-Tuning and Model Customization

> **Duration**: 14 hours | **Certification Path**: AI Engineer, ML Engineer
> **Prerequisites**: Modules 1-4

---

## Module Overview

Fine-tuning customizes pre-trained models for specific tasks. This module covers when to fine-tune, preparation, training, and deployment of custom models.

---

## Learning Objectives

1. Decide when fine-tuning is appropriate vs prompting/RAG
2. Prepare datasets for fine-tuning
3. Execute fine-tuning with OpenAI and open-source models
4. Evaluate and iterate on fine-tuned models
5. Deploy and monitor custom models
