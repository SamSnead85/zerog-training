# Unit 1: RAG Foundations

> **Unit Duration**: 4 hours | **Lessons**: 4
> **Module**: 3 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation

---

## Unit Overview

RAG is the pattern that makes LLMs useful for real business applications. This unit covers why RAG exists, how it works, and the fundamental concepts of embeddings and similarity search.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, you will be able to:

1. Explain why LLMs need external knowledge
2. Describe the complete RAG architecture
3. Create and interpret vector embeddings
4. Implement similarity search for retrieval

## Lesson List

| Lesson | Topic | Duration | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1.1 | Why RAG? | 45 min | LLM limitations, knowledge cutoff, hallucination |
| 1.2 | RAG Architecture | 50 min | Indexing, retrieval, generation flow |
| 1.3 | Embeddings Deep Dive | 55 min | Vectors, models, semantic similarity |
| 1.4 | Similarity Search | 50 min | Distance metrics, ANN algorithms |

## Why This Unit Matters

Without RAG, LLMs:
- Don't know your company's data
- Have outdated training cutoffs
- Hallucinate confidently
- Can't cite sources

RAG solves all of this. This unit gives you the conceptual foundation for everything that follows.
