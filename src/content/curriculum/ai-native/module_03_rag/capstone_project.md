# Module 3 Capstone Project: Enterprise Knowledge Base

> **Duration**: 8-10 hours | **Type**: Comprehensive Assessment
> **Submission**: Working System + Documentation

---

## Project Overview

Build a production-ready RAG system for an enterprise knowledge base. This capstone tests all Module 3 skills.

---

## Requirements

### Part 1: Document Ingestion (2 hours)

Build a pipeline that:
- Loads 100+ documents (PDF, Markdown, HTML)
- Implements smart chunking strategy
- Extracts and stores rich metadata
- Supports incremental updates

### Part 2: Vector Store (2 hours)

Implement storage with:
- Production vector database (Pinecone/Qdrant)
- Proper indexing configuration
- Namespace or tenant isolation
- Metadata filtering capability

### Part 3: Advanced Retrieval (2 hours)

Build retrieval that includes:
- Query transformation (expansion or HyDE)
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Re-ranking for quality
- Contextual compression

### Part 4: Evaluation & Monitoring (2 hours)

Create:
- 50+ question evaluation dataset
- Automated evaluation pipeline
- Latency and quality metrics dashboard
- Failure case analysis

### Part 5: Production Features (2 hours)

Implement:
- Semantic caching
- Multi-user access control
- Audit logging
- Error handling and fallbacks
