# Module 2 Capstone Project: Prompt Engineering Portfolio

> **Duration**: 5-7 hours | **Type**: Comprehensive Assessment
> **Submission**: Portfolio + Working System

---

## Project Overview

Build a prompt engineering portfolio demonstrating mastery of all Module 2 techniques. You'll create a working system plus documentation of your prompt engineering process.

## Requirements

### Part 1: Production Prompt Library (2 hours)

Create a reusable prompt library with:
- 10+ templates covering different use cases
- Version control for each prompt
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Documentation for each prompt

**Deliverables**:
- `prompts/` directory with organized templates
- `prompt_manager.py` with registry, versioning, A/B tests
- `README.md` with usage examples

### Part 2: Extraction Pipeline (2 hours)

Build a robust data extraction system:
- Define 3+ Pydantic schemas for real data types
- Implement JSON mode + structured outputs
- Add validation, retry, and error handling
- Include logging and metrics

**Deliverables**:
- Working extraction code
- 20+ test cases with expected outputs
- Error handling documentation

### Part 3: Domain Application (2 hours)

Choose ONE domain and build a complete solution:

**Option A: Code Assistant**
- Generate, debug, and review code
- Support 3+ programming languages
- Include test generation

**Option B: Content Studio**
- Blog post generator
- Social media adapter
- Email sequence builder

**Option C: Research Analyst**
- Document summarizer
- Multi-source synthesizer
- Comparison report generator

### Part 4: Security Review (1 hour)

Document security measures:
- Input sanitization approach
- Prompt injection defenses
- Output validation
- Audit logging
