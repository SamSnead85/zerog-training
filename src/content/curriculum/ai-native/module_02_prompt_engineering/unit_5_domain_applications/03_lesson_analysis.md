## 📚 Reading Material

### Analysis Prompting

Analysis prompts extract insights from data and documents:
- Summarization (compress information)
- Synthesis (combine sources)
- Evaluation (assess quality/fit)
- Comparison (contrast options)

### Summarization Patterns

**Executive summary**:
```
Summarize this document for a CEO:
- Max 5 bullet points
- Focus on strategic implications
- Highlight key decisions needed
- Skip technical details

[document]
```

**Layered summary**:
```
Create a 3-layer summary:
1. One-sentence headline
2. Three key points (bullet)
3. Detailed paragraph with evidence

[document]
```

### Synthesis Patterns

**Cross-document synthesis**:
```
Synthesize insights from these 3 sources:

Source 1: [text]
Source 2: [text]
Source 3: [text]

Identify:
- Common themes
- Contradictions
- Unique insights per source
- Overall conclusion
```

### Comparison Patterns

```
Compare these options:

Option A: [description]
Option B: [description]
Option C: [description]

Criteria: cost, speed, risk, scalability
Format: markdown table with scores 1-5
Recommendation: with justification
```

### Research Synthesis

```
Based on this information:
[context]

Answer these questions:
1. [question]
2. [question]

For each answer:
- State the answer clearly
- Cite the specific evidence
- Note confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Flag any gaps in information
```

## 🎬 Video Script

**[INTRO - Analysis diagram]**

Analysis prompts turn information into insights. Summarize, synthesize, compare, evaluate.

**[CUT TO: Summarization]**

Specify audience and format. Executive summary: strategic, brief. Technical summary: detailed, complete. Layer summaries for different depths.

**[CUT TO: Synthesis]**

Synthesis combines sources. Ask for themes, contradictions, unique insights. The model connects dots across documents.

**[CUT TO: Comparison]**

Comparisons need criteria. Ask for tables, scores, recommendations. Always request justification.

**[END - Runtime: 4:00]**
