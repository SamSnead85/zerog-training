### Content Prompting Principles

Content prompts need:
- Clear audience definition
- Specific tone and style
- Structural requirements
- Brand voice alignment

### The Content Brief

```
AUDIENCE: B2B SaaS marketing managers
GOAL: Drive demo signups
TONE: Professional but approachable
LENGTH: 150 words
FORMAT: Email body (no subject line)

CONTEXT:
- Product: AI-powered analytics platform
- Key benefit: 50% faster insights
- CTA: Book a demo

CONSTRAINTS:
- No hyperbole ("best", "revolutionary")
- Use second person ("you")
- Include one statistic
```

### Writing Patterns

**Blog posts**:
```
Write a 500-word blog post on [topic] for [audience].

Structure:
- Hook intro (1 para)
- 3 key points with subheadings
- Actionable conclusion

Keywords to include: [list]
Avoid: [competitor mentions, technical jargon]
```

**Social media**:
```
Write 3 LinkedIn post variations for:
Topic: [your topic]
Goal: [awareness/engagement/clicks]
Audience: [description]

Each version:
- Under 300 characters
- Include emoji strategically
- End with question or CTA
```

**Email sequences**:
```
Write a 3-email nurture sequence:
Trigger: Downloaded whitepaper on [topic]
Goal: Book a demo call

Email 1 (Day 0): Thank and introduce value
Email 2 (Day 3): Case study + social proof
Email 3 (Day 7): Direct ask with urgency
```

### Editing and Refinement

**Tone adjustment**:
```
Rewrite this more formally / casually / urgently:
[original text]
```

**Length adjustment**:
```
Condense to 50 words without losing key points:
[original text]
```

**Style matching**:
```
Rewrite in the style of:
- The Economist (authoritative, witty)
- Apple marketing (simple, aspirational)
- McKinsey (analytical, evidence-based)

[original text]
```

## 🎬 Video Script

**[INTRO - Content comparison]**

Content prompts need precision about audience, tone, and structure. Generic prompts produce generic content.

**[CUT TO: Content brief]**

Start with a brief: audience, goal, tone, length, format. Add context about the brand, product, constraints. The more specific, the better.

**[CUT TO: Patterns]**

For blogs: structure with intro, sections, conclusion. For social: character limits, platform conventions. For emails: sequences that build toward action.

**[CUT TO: Refinement]**

Refinement prompts adjust existing content: formal to casual, long to short, generic to brand-specific. Chain generation then refinement.

**[END - Runtime: 4:00]**
