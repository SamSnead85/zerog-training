## Unit Overview

Before advanced techniques, master the fundamentals. This unit covers the essential components of effective prompts—the building blocks everything else is built upon.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, you will be able to:

1. Identify and construct the key components of a prompt
2. Use the system-user-assistant pattern effectively
3. Write clear, unambiguous instructions
4. Control output format and structure
5. Debug common prompting mistakes

## Why This Matters

Poor prompts are the #1 cause of AI project failures. The difference between a vague prompt and a precise prompt can be:
- 10x improvement in output quality
- 50% reduction in iteration cycles
- 80% fewer hallucinations

This unit ensures you build on a solid foundation.
