## Why These Techniques Matter

These aren't academic curiosities—they're production essentials:

- **Few-shot**: 10-50% accuracy improvement on classification tasks
- **Chain-of-thought**: 70% error reduction on reasoning problems
- **Self-consistency**: 20-30% reliability improvement for critical tasks
- **Prompt chaining**: Only way to handle complex multi-step workflows

Master these and you'll handle tasks others think impossible.
