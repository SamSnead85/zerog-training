# Unit 4: Production Prompting

> **Unit Duration**: 4 hours | **Lessons**: 4
> **Module**: 2 - Prompt Engineering Mastery

---

## Unit Overview

Prompts in production are different from prompts in notebooks. This unit covers the practices that make prompts maintainable, testable, optimized, and secure.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, you will be able to:

1. Build reusable prompt template systems
2. Test and evaluate prompts systematically
3. Optimize prompts for cost and latency
4. Defend against prompt injection attacks

## Lesson List

| Lesson | Topic | Duration | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 4.1 | Prompt Templates & Management | 50 min | Templating, versioning, libraries |
| 4.2 | Testing & Evaluation | 55 min | Test suites, metrics, regression |
| 4.3 | Optimization for Cost & Speed | 55 min | Token reduction, caching, batching |
| 4.4 | Security & Prompt Injection | 60 min | Attack vectors, defenses, sandboxing |

## Why This Matters

Production systems need:
- **Maintainability**: Change prompts without code deploys
- **Reliability**: Catch regressions before users do
- **Efficiency**: Control costs at scale
- **Security**: Resist adversarial inputs
