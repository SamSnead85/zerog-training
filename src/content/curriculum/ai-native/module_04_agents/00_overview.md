# Module 4: Agents and Tool Use

> **Duration**: 16 hours | **Certification Path**: All Paths (Required)
> **Prerequisites**: Module 2 - Prompt Engineering, Module 3 - RAG

---

## Module Overview

Agents are AI systems that take actions, not just generate text. They plan, use tools, and iterate toward goals. This module teaches you to build reliable agentic systems.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand when agents are appropriate vs simpler patterns
2. Build tool-using agents with function calling
3. Implement planning and reasoning patterns
4. Create multi-agent systems
5. Handle errors and ensure reliability
6. Deploy agents safely in production
