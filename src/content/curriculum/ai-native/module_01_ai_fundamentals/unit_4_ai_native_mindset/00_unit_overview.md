# Unit 4: The AI-Native Mindset

> **Unit Duration**: 4.5 hours | **Lessons**: 5 + Lab
> **Module**: 1 - AI Fundamentals for Modern Development

---

## Unit Overview

This unit transforms how you think about problems. The "AI-Native mindset" isn't about using AI everywhere—it's about knowing when AI adds value, when it doesn't, and how to decompose problems for human-AI collaboration.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, you will be able to:

1. Define what "AI-Native" means versus "AI-Augmented"
2. Identify task categories where AI excels
3. Recognize when NOT to use AI
4. Decompose complex problems for AI-human collaboration
5. Design hybrid workflows that leverage both AI and human strengths

## Lesson List

| Lesson | Topic | Duration | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 4.1 | What Does "AI-Native" Mean? | 40 min | Mindset shift, AI-first design |
| 4.2 | Pattern Recognition: Where AI Excels | 50 min | Task taxonomy, AI strengths |
| 4.3 | When NOT to Use AI | 45 min | Limitations, failure modes |
| 4.4 | AI-First Problem Decomposition | 55 min | Task breakdown, orchestration |
| 4.5 | Building Hybrid Human-AI Systems | 45 min | Workflow design, handoffs |

## Why This Matters

The biggest AI failures aren't technical—they're strategic. Teams use AI where it doesn't fit, miss opportunities where it would excel, and fail to design for human-AI collaboration.

This unit ensures you make better decisions about when and how to apply AI.
