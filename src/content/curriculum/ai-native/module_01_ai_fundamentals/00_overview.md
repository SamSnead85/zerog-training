# Module 1: AI Fundamentals for Modern Development

> **Duration**: 25 hours | **Level**: Beginner | **Prerequisites**: None
> **Certification**: AI-Native Foundations (1 of 3)

---

## Module Description

This foundational module transforms your understanding of artificial intelligence from buzzword familiarity to practical, working knowledge. You'll learn not just what AI can do, but how it actually works under the hood—from the mathematics of neural networks to the economics of API calls. By the end of this module, you'll think about problems differently, naturally identifying where AI can add value and where traditional approaches remain superior.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between AI, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI with precision
2. **Explain** how transformer architectures and attention mechanisms enable modern LLMs
3. **Describe** the complete LLM training pipeline: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF
4. **Calculate** the cost of AI API calls using tokenization and pricing models
5. **Evaluate** different AI models based on capability, latency, and cost tradeoffs
6. **Identify** opportunities for AI automation in business processes
7. **Apply** the AI-Native mindset to problem decomposition
8. **Compare** the major AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) and their offerings
9. **Recognize** when NOT to use AI—understanding its limitations
10. **Design** a high-level AI solution proposal for a business problem

## Capstone Project: AI Solution Proposal

**Duration**: 5 hours | **Format**: Written Proposal + Presentation

### Project Brief

You work as a technology consultant. A mid-size financial services company (500 employees) has approached you to identify opportunities for AI implementation. They have shared the following pain points:

1. Customer service reps spend 40% of their time looking up information across multiple systems
2. Compliance reviews of client communications take 3 full-time employees
3. New employee onboarding requires 2 weeks of shadowing before productivity
4. Monthly report generation takes the analytics team 5 days

**Your Task**: Select ONE problem and create a comprehensive AI solution proposal.

### Deliverables

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution overview
   - Expected ROI

2. **Technical Approach** (2-3 pages)
   - AI architecture (RAG, agents, fine-tuning, etc.)
   - Model selection with justification
   - Data requirements and privacy considerations
   - Integration approach

3. **Economics Analysis** (1 page)
   - Cost modeling (development + ongoing)
   - Token/API cost projections
   - Break-even analysis

4. **Risk Assessment** (1 page)
   - Technical risks
   - Organizational risks
   - Mitigation strategies

5. **Implementation Roadmap** (1 page)
   - Phased approach
   - Success metrics
   - Timeline
