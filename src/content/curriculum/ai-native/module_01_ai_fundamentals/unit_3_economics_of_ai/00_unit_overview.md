# Unit 3: The Economics of AI

> **Unit Duration**: 4 hours | **Lessons**: 4 + Lab
> **Module**: 1 - AI Fundamentals for Modern Development

---

## Unit Overview

Understanding AI economics is essential for making informed decisions about when, where, and how to use AI. This unit covers token-based pricing, context window costs, latency tradeoffs, and model selection criteria.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, you will be able to:

1. Calculate the cost of AI API calls using tokenization and pricing models
2. Explain how context window size affects both cost and latency
3. Evaluate latency, throughput, and cost tradeoffs for different use cases
4. Select appropriate models for specific tasks and budgets
5. Optimize prompts and workflows for cost efficiency

## Lesson List

| Lesson | Topic | Duration | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 3.1 | Understanding Token-Based Pricing | 50 min | Tokens, pricing tiers, cost calculation |
| 3.2 | Context Windows and Cost | 45 min | Context limits, prompt caching, optimization |
| 3.3 | Latency, Throughput, and Tradeoffs | 45 min | Response time, batching, streaming |
| 3.4 | Choosing the Right Model | 60 min | Model comparison, benchmarks, selection framework |

## Why This Matters

Many AI projects fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because:
- Costs spiral out of control at scale
- Latency makes real-time use impossible
- Wrong model selection wastes resources
- Poor prompt design multiplies costs

This unit ensures you can build economically viable AI applications.
