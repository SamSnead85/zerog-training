## Pillar 2: Uncompromising Pedagogical Rigor

Expert knowledge must be translated into effective learning. Our entire content development process is managed by certified instructional design professionals who ensure every course is built on the foundation of learning science.

### Instructional Design Team Qualifications

- **Certified Professional in Talent Development (CPTD)** from ATD, or
- **Master's Degree** in Instructional Design, Adult Education, or Learning Sciences
- Minimum **5 years** experience in corporate learning design
- Demonstrated expertise in digital and blended learning

### The Learning Science Foundation

Every ZeroG course is built using proven instructional design frameworks:

**Bloom's Taxonomy for Objectives:**
We write learning objectives at appropriate cognitive levels:

| Level | Verb Examples | ZeroG Application |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Remember | List, Define, Recall | Foundation courses establish terminology |
| Understand | Explain, Describe, Summarize | Conceptual understanding before application |
| Apply | Demonstrate, Use, Implement | Hands-on labs and exercises |
| Analyze | Compare, Differentiate, Examine | Case study analysis |
| Evaluate | Judge, Critique, Assess | Decision-making simulations |
| Create | Design, Develop, Construct | Capstone projects |

**Gagné's Nine Events in Every Module:**

1. **Gain Attention:** Real-world scenario opens module
2. **Inform Objectives:** Clear learning goals stated upfront
3. **Stimulate Recall:** Connection to prior knowledge
4. **Present Content:** Multi-modal delivery
5. **Provide Guidance:** Frameworks and examples
6. **Elicit Performance:** Practice exercises
7. **Provide Feedback:** Immediate, specific feedback
8. **Assess Performance:** Competency-based assessment
9. **Enhance Transfer:** Job aids and application assignments

**Mayer's Multimedia Principles:**
Our visual design optimizes cognitive load:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Coherence | Remove extraneous content |
| Signaling | Highlight essential information |
| Redundancy | Avoid duplication of narration and text |
| Spatial Contiguity | Place related content close together |
| Temporal Contiguity | Present related content simultaneously |
| Segmenting | Break content into manageable chunks |
| Modality | Use audio with visuals, not text with visuals |

---

## Pillar 3: Strict Standards Alignment

Credibility comes from alignment with globally recognized standards. Our content is meticulously mapped to the frameworks that matter most to enterprises.

### Content Framework Alignment

| Domain | Standard | Our Alignment |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 | Every module mapped to specific categories and subcategories |
| **HIPAA** | HHS/OCR Guidelines | Complete Privacy, Security, and Breach Rule coverage |
| **AI/ML** | NIST AI Risk Management Framework | Ethics and governance content aligned to NIST AI RMF |
| **Leadership** | Center for Creative Leadership Competency Model | Research-validated competency framework |

### Technical Interoperability

**SCORM & xAPI Conformance:**
All ZeroG courses are fully compliant with:
- **SCORM 1.2** for legacy LMS compatibility
- **SCORM 2004 (4th Edition)** for advanced sequencing
- **xAPI (Experience API)** for rich learning activity tracking

This ensures seamless integration with any modern LMS and enables detailed analytics.

### Accreditation & CEUs

## The ZeroG Philosophy: Democratizing Enterprise Training

### Your Training, Your Way

For too long, enterprise training has been one-size-fits-all. Learners forced into rigid schedules, generic content, and delivery methods that don't match their needs.

At ZeroG, we are fundamentally changing that paradigm. We are **democratizing training**, putting the power back into your hands.

### The Power of Learner Control

| Principle | What It Means | How We Deliver |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **The Training You Want** | Access what you need, when you need it | 24/7 on-demand library, any device |
| **The Content You Need** | Personalized to your role and goals | Role-based paths, AI recommendations |
| **The Delivery That Works** | Learn the way you learn best | Multi-modal: video, text, simulation, labs |
| **The Pace That Fits** | No arbitrary timelines | Self-paced with mastery-based progression |

### Deeply Modular Content

Our courses aren't monolithic blocks. They're composed of granular, modular components:
- Need just one concept? Access that single module
- Want the full certification? Follow the complete path
- Preparing for audit? Jump to compliance essentials
- Building custom curriculum? Mix and match modules

### AI-Powered Customization

With our AI Training Studio, you can:
- Infuse generic content with your organization's policies
- Add industry-specific case studies
- Incorporate your company's real examples
- Create truly bespoke training in hours, not months
