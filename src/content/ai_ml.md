## Beyond Tool Tips: True AI Fluency

The AI revolution isn't coming—it's here. But most AI training falls into two traps: either it's so superficial that learners can't apply concepts beyond cookbook recipes, or so technical that it overwhelms non-engineers and misses the strategic picture.

**ZeroG's AI & Machine Learning Mastery curriculum takes a different approach.**

We've designed three distinct learning paths that build genuine understanding—from foundational literacy through practical productivity to strategic leadership. Every module connects technical concepts to real-world application, grounded in learning science that ensures retention and transfer.

## Learning Path 1: AI Literacy for Everyone
### *Building Foundational Understanding Across Your Organization*

**Duration:** 8 hours | **Modules:** 10 | **Level:** Foundational

Before your workforce can leverage AI effectively, they need to understand what it is, how it works, and what it can (and cannot) do. This path builds that foundational fluency.

### Modules

#### Module L1.1: Understanding Artificial Intelligence
**Duration:** 60 min | **Bloom's Level:** Remember, Understand

**Learning Objectives:**
- Define artificial intelligence and distinguish it from automation and analytics
- Explain the relationship between AI, machine learning, and deep learning
- Identify current AI capabilities and limitations across domains

**Core Topics:**

**What AI Actually Is (And Isn't)**
Artificial intelligence is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. But the reality is more nuanced than the hype suggests:

| AI Reality | Common Misconception |
|------------|---------------------|
| Narrow AI excels at specific tasks | AI can do anything a human can |
| AI requires massive training data | AI learns like humans from few examples |
| AI finds patterns in data | AI truly "understands" concepts |
| AI can be wrong confidently | AI outputs are always reliable |
| AI reflects biases in training data | AI is objective and unbiased |

**The AI Family Tree:**
```
Artificial Intelligence (Broad field)
├── Machine Learning (Learning from data)
│   ├── Supervised Learning (Labeled examples)
│   ├── Unsupervised Learning (Finding patterns)
│   ├── Reinforcement Learning (Trial and error)
│   └── Deep Learning (Neural networks)
│       ├── Convolutional Neural Networks (Images)
│       ├── Recurrent Neural Networks (Sequences)
│       └── Transformers (Language, attention)
│           └── Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude)
└── Symbolic AI, Expert Systems, etc.
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Today's AI is narrow and specialized—not general intelligence
- AI capabilities emerge from patterns in data, not true understanding
- Understanding limitations is as important as understanding capabilities

---

#### Module L1.2: How Machine Learning Actually Works
**Duration:** 60 min | **Bloom's Level:** Understand, Apply

**Learning Objectives:**
- Explain the machine learning process from data to prediction
- Distinguish between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Identify which type of ML applies to different business problems

**Core Topics:**

**The Machine Learning Recipe:**
1. **Collect Data:** Gather examples of what you want the model to learn
2. **Prepare Data:** Clean, label, and format data for training
3. **Choose Model:** Select an algorithm appropriate to the problem
4. **Train Model:** Feed data through the model, adjusting parameters
5. **Evaluate:** Test on data the model hasn't seen
6. **Deploy:** Put the model into production use
7. **Monitor:** Track performance and retrain as needed

**Types of Machine Learning:**

| Type | What It Does | Example Applications |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Learns from labeled examples to predict outcomes | Email spam detection, loan approval, medical diagnosis |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | Finds patterns and structure in unlabeled data | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic modeling |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learns through trial, error, and rewards | Game playing, robotics, recommendation optimization |

**Scenario Exercise:**
> *Your company wants to predict which customers are likely to churn. What type of ML is this? What data would you need? What are the potential pitfalls?*

#### Module L1.3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks Demystified
**Duration:** 45 min | **Bloom's Level:** Understand

**Learning Objectives:**
- Explain neural networks using intuitive analogies (without requiring math)
- Describe how deep learning differs from traditional machine learning
- Identify applications where deep learning excels

**Core Topics:**

**Neural Networks: A Simple Mental Model**

Think of a neural network as a sophisticated voting system:
- **Input Layer:** Raw data comes in (pixels, words, numbers)
- **Hidden Layers:** Each layer transforms and combines information
- **Output Layer:** Final decision or prediction emerges

Each connection has a "weight" that determines how much influence one neuron has on another. Training adjusts these weights until the network produces correct outputs for training examples.

**Why "Deep" Learning?**
- Traditional ML: 1-2 processing layers
- Deep Learning: Dozens to hundreds of layers
- More layers = ability to learn more complex patterns

**Visualization aid included: Interactive neural network demonstration**

---

#### Module L1.4: Large Language Models: How ChatGPT Works
**Duration:** 60 min | **Bloom's Level:** Understand, Apply

**Learning Objectives:**
- Explain the transformer architecture at a conceptual level
- Describe how LLMs are trained and what they actually learn
- Recognize the capabilities and limitations of language models

**Core Topics:**

**The Transformer Revolution**

Before 2017, AI struggled with language. The transformer architecture changed everything through a simple but powerful idea: **attention**.

**How Transformers Work (Conceptually):**
1. **Tokenization:** Text is broken into pieces (tokens)
2. **Embeddings:** Tokens become numerical vectors capturing meaning
3. **Attention:** The model learns which words relate to which other words
4. **Prediction:** Given context, predict the most likely next token

**What LLMs Actually Do:**
- Predict the most statistically likely next token
- Match patterns from vast training data
- Generate fluent text that follows learned patterns

**What LLMs Do NOT Do:**
- Understand in the way humans understand
- Access real-time information (typically)
- Reason reliably about novel situations
- Guarantee factual accuracy

**The Hallucination Problem:**
LLMs generate plausible-sounding but potentially false information because they're optimizing for fluency and pattern-matching, not truth.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify ethical considerations in AI development and deployment
- Recognize bias in AI systems and its sources
- Apply ethical frameworks to AI decision-making

**Core Topics:**

**The Ethics of AI Systems**

AI systems can perpetuate and amplify societal biases, make life-altering decisions without transparency, and create new forms of harm. Responsible AI use requires understanding these risks.

**Sources of AI Bias:**
| Stage | Bias Source | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Data Collection | Who's represented in training data | Medical AI trained mostly on one demographic |
| Labeling | Human biases in annotations | Beauty scoring reflecting cultural biases |
| Algorithm | Optimization targets | Hiring AI optimizing for "culture fit" |
| Deployment | Differential impact | Facial recognition accuracy varying by skin tone |
| Feedback | Reinforcing existing patterns | Recommendation systems creating filter bubbles |

**Ethical Framework for AI Decisions:**
1. **Fairness:** Does this treat all groups equitably?
2. **Transparency:** Can we explain how decisions are made?
3. **Accountability:** Who is responsible when something goes wrong?
4. **Privacy:** How is personal data being used?
5. **Safety:** What could go wrong, and how bad would it be?

**Case Study: Facial Recognition in Hiring**
> *A company uses AI to analyze video interviews. Analysis: What could go wrong? Who might be harmed? What safeguards would you require?*
