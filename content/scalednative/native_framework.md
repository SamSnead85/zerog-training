# The NATIVE Framework

## Introduction

### Headline
The NATIVE Framework: The Enterprise Standard for AI-Native Transformation

### What is NATIVE?

NATIVE is an enterprise operating framework where AI is embedded into how work is designed, decisions are made, and value is created.

Unlike point solutions that teach individual tools, the NATIVE framework provides a comprehensive structure for organizational transformation:

- **Shared vocabulary** that aligns executives, managers, and practitioners
- **Clear progression paths** from individual literacy to organizational capability
- **Role-based learning tracks** that respect different job functions
- **Verified certifications** that prove real competency
- **Governance standards** that enable speed, not bureaucracy

## The NATIVE Acronym

NATIVE represents the 6 essential capability tracks for AI-Native transformation:

| Letter | Track | Core Focus |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **N** | Navigate | AI literacy, responsible use, knowing when and how to use AI |
| **A** | Architect | Designing AI systems, strategy, and enterprise architecture |
| **T** | Transform | Leading change, adoption management, organizational design |
| **I** | Integrate | Building and deploying AI solutions, DevOps, operations |
| **V** | Validate | Security, compliance, governance, quality assurance |
| **E** | Evolve | Continuous learning, emerging technologies, advanced research |
