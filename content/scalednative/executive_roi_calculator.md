| **Retention** | 10-20% improved retention for trained staff | Turnover rates, engagement |

---

## ROI Calculator Framework

### Step 1: Define Scope

| Input | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Number of employees to train | 500 |
| Average fully-loaded cost per employee | $120,000/year |
| Average hours spent on AI-suitable tasks per week | 10 hours |
| Current AI usage rate | 15% |

### Step 2: Calculate Productivity Gains

**Conservative Estimate**: 20% productivity improvement on AI-suitable tasks

| Calculation | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Annual hours on AI-suitable tasks | Employees × Hours × 52 | 500 × 10 × 52 = 260,000 hrs |
| Hours saved (20% improvement) | Annual hours × 20% | 260,000 × 0.20 = 52,000 hrs |
| Value of saved hours | Hours saved × (Fully loaded cost ÷ 2,080) | 52,000 × $57.69 = **$3,000,000** |

### Step 3: Calculate Quality Improvements

**Conservative Estimate**: 15% reduction in errors requiring rework

| Calculation | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Employees generating content/code | 40% of trained population | 200 employees |
| Hours spent on rework per employee per year | Industry average | 80 hours |
| Hours eliminated (15% reduction) | Rework hours × 15% | 200 × 80 × 0.15 = 2,400 hrs |
| Value of eliminated rework | Hours × hourly rate | 2,400 × $57.69 = **$138,456** |

### Step 4: Calculate Speed Improvements

**Conservative Estimate**: 30% faster onboarding for new AI initiatives

| Calculation | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| AI projects launched per year | Organization estimate | 10 projects |
| Average project team size | Organization estimate | 8 people |
| Weeks saved per project (30% faster) | Baseline × 30% | 2 weeks per project |
| Value of acceleration | Team size × weeks × weekly cost | 10 × 8 × 2 × $2,308 = **$369,280** |

### Step 5: Calculate Retention Impact

**Conservative Estimate**: 15% improved retention for invested employees

| Calculation | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Annual turnover rate | Organization data | 15% |
| Cost to replace an employee | Industry average | 50% of salary |
| Employees retained due to training | Trained × Turnover × 15% improvement | 500 × 0.15 × 0.15 = 11 employees |
| Value of retention | Retained × replacement cost | 11 × $60,000 = **$660,000** |

### Step 6: Calculate Total Benefits

| Benefit Category | Annual Value |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Productivity Gains | $3,000,000 |
| Quality Improvements | $138,456 |
| Speed Improvements | $369,280 |
| Retention Impact | $660,000 |
| **Total Annual Benefits** | **$4,167,736** |

### Step 7: Calculate Investment

| Investment | Annual Cost |
|------------|-------------|
| ScaledNative Platform (enterprise license) | $150,000 |
| Internal administration (0.5 FTE) | $60,000 |
| Time for training (10 hrs × 500 × $57.69) | $288,450 |
| **Total Investment** | **$498,450** |

### Step 8: Calculate ROI

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Net Benefit | Benefits - Investment | $3,669,286 |
| ROI | (Net Benefit ÷ Investment) × 100 | **736%** |
| Payback Period | Investment ÷ (Benefits ÷ 12) | **1.4 months** |
