# NATIVE Certification Program

## Introduction

### Headline
NATIVE Certification: Validate Real Capability, Not Tool Familiarity

### Body
NATIVE certifications are not about memorizing features or clicking through slides. They are about demonstrating competency through hands-on verification.

Every certification requires passing automated skill verification labs. No shortcuts. No completion-only badges.

When someone holds a NATIVE certification, you know they can do the work.
