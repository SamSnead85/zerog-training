# The NATIVE Framework

## Introduction

### Headline
The NATIVE Framework

### Subheadline
The Proven Framework for Enterprise AI Transformation

### Body
NATIVE is an enterprise operating framework where AI is embedded into how work is designed, decisions are made, and value is created.

This is not tool-specific training. This is organizational transformation.

NATIVE provides the shared language, maturity model, and certification ecosystem that enterprises need to move from scattered AI experiments to coordinated AI capability.

## NATIVE Best Practices

### Practice 1: AI Capability is a System, Not a Skill

**The Principle**: Treating AI as individual training misses the point. AI capability requires organizational infrastructure: governance, standards, shared context, and coordinated workflows.

**In Practice**:
- Build organizational AI standards alongside individual training
- Create shared prompt libraries and best practices
- Establish governance that enables, not restricts
- Measure organizational capability, not just individual completion

---

### Practice 2: Training Must Evolve with the Organization

**The Principle**: One-time AI training becomes obsolete in months. Continuous learning is the only path to sustained capability.

**In Practice**:
- Implement spaced repetition for skill retention
- Update curriculum as AI capabilities evolve
- Require certification renewal every 2 years
- Build learning into daily work, not just annual events

---

### Practice 3: Context Matters More Than Model Sophistication

**The Principle**: Enterprise AI success depends on organizational context, not just the latest models. Your policies, workflows, and domain knowledge determine AI effectiveness.

**In Practice**:
- Infuse training with organizational context
- Build internal knowledge bases for AI consumption
- Train on your specific use cases, not generic examples
- Measure outcomes in business terms, not AI terms

---

### Practice 4: Governance Enables Speed

**The Principle**: Clear standards and guardrails allow faster, safer AI adoption. Ambiguity creates paralysis.

**In Practice**:
- Establish clear AI usage policies upfront
- Define what AI can and cannot do in your organization
- Create approval pathways for new AI use cases
- Enable experimentation within guardrails

---

### Practice 5: Certification Creates Alignment and Accountability

**The Principle**: Certified practitioners speak a common language and follow common standards. Certification creates accountability and accelerates adoption.

**In Practice**:
- Require certification for AI-intensive roles
- Recognize and reward certified practitioners
- Use certification levels to guide career development
- Build certification into performance expectations
