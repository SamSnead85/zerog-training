Become AI-Native. At Scale.

### Subheadline
ScaledNative is the enterprise framework for AI transformation. Not training. Transformation.

### Body
Most organizations are stuck in pilot chaos: fragmented AI initiatives, no shared language, and no clear path from individual literacy to organizational capability. ScaledNative provides the NATIVE framework, certification ecosystem, and training platform to move from chaos to verified capability.

## The Problem Section

### Headline
Your Organization is Stuck in Pilot Chaos

### Body
Every department is experimenting with AI, but nobody is transforming.

**The symptoms are everywhere:**

- **Fragmented Initiatives**: Marketing uses ChatGPT. Engineering uses Copilot. Sales uses a different tool. No coordination.
- **No Shared Language**: When your CEO says "AI-Native," does everyone agree what that means?
- **Tool-Specific Training**: Teaching employees to click buttons in ChatGPT is not transformation.
- **No Clear Path**: You have AI literacy programs, but no roadmap to organizational capability.
- **Compliance Paralysis**: Legal and security concerns are slowing adoption, not enabling it.

**The result?** Millions in AI investment. Pilots that never scale. Competitors pulling ahead.

## The Solution Section

### Headline
The NATIVE Framework: Your Operating System for AI Transformation

### Body
NATIVE is an enterprise operating framework where AI is embedded into how work is designed, decisions are made, and value is created.

**NATIVE is not an acronym. It is a concept.**

Just as "cloud-native" transformed how software is built, "AI-Native" transforms how organizations operate.

The NATIVE framework provides:

- **4 Maturity Levels**: Clear progression from individual literacy to organizational capability
- **4 Certifications**: Verified skills, not participation badges
- **Role-Based Pathways**: Customized training for developers, product managers, leaders, and everyone
- **Governance Standards**: Guardrails that enable speed, not bureaucracy
- **Shared Language**: Everyone speaks the same AI language

2. NATIVE Teams

4. NATIVE Operating Model
