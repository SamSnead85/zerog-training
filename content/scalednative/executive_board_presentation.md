## Common Board Questions and Answers

**Q: Why now? What's the urgency?**
A: The competitive window is 18-24 months. First movers in AI-Native operations are creating durable advantages that will be difficult to close.

**Q: Why not build this internally?**
A: We considered internal development. A framework-based approach with platform support provides faster time-to-value, proven methodology, and lower risk than building from scratch.

**Q: What if AI changes significantly?**
A: The NATIVE framework is technology-agnostic. Curriculum updates continuously. Certification renewal every 2 years ensures currency.

**Q: How do we measure success?**
A: Kirkpatrick Model evaluation: reaction (satisfaction), learning (certification), behavior (usage), results (business impact). Quarterly reporting to Board.

**Q: What are the biggest risks?**
A: Adoption risk (mitigated by change management), compliance risk (mitigated by governance), vendor risk (mitigated by platform flexibility).
