## The Curriculum Philosophy

### Why Our Training is Different

**Depth Over Breadth**
We go deep. Each module includes theory, practical application, hands-on labs, and real-world case studies. No skimming the surface.

**Role-Based Paths**
A developer needs different AI skills than a product manager. A leader needs different skills than an individual contributor. Every role gets a customized path.

**Verified Skills**
Every module includes hands-on verification labs. Multiple choice tests are not enough. We verify that you can do the work.

**Framework-Grounded**
Our curriculum is built on proven instructional design frameworks (Kirkpatrick Model), cognitive science (spaced repetition, microlearning), and industry standards (NIST, responsible AI).

**Continuously Updated**
AI moves fast. Our curriculum is updated quarterly to reflect new capabilities, best practices, and organizational learnings.
